## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are available before running the application:

- **üêç Python (~=3.11)**
- **üêò PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Database for storing product and user information.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Git** ‚Äì Version control system.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Account** - cloud infrastructure, providing RDS, ECS, S3 and Systems Manager

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation (local)

### üîπ Clone Repository

```sh
git clone --branch main https://github.com/jolewen/AWS_grocery.git && cd AWS_grocery
```

#### Configure PostgreSQL
Before creating the database user, you can choose a custom username and password
to enhance security. Replace `<your_secure_password>` with a strong password of
your choice in the following commands.

Create database and user:

```sh
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE grocerymate_db;"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER grocery_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<your_secure_password>';"  # Replace <your_secure_password> with a strong password of your choice
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER grocery_user WITH SUPERUSER;"
```

#### Populate Database

```sh
psql -U grocery_user -d grocerymate_db -f backend/app/sqlite_dump_clean.sql
```

Verify insertion:

```sh
psql -U grocery_user -d grocerymate_db -c "SELECT * FROM users;"
psql -U grocery_user -d grocerymate_db -c "SELECT * FROM products;"
```

### üîπ Set Up Python Environment

Install dependencies in an activated virtual Enviroment:

```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OR (if pip doesn't exist)

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### üîπ Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```sh
touch .env  # macOS/Linux
ni .env -Force  # Windows
```

Generate a secure JWT key:

```sh
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Update `.env`:

```sh
vim .env
```

Fill in the following information (make sure to replace the placeholders):

```ini
JWT_SECRET_KEY = <your_generated_key>
POSTGRES_USER = grocery_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = <your_password>
POSTGRES_DB = grocerymate_db
POSTGRES_HOST = localhost
POSTGRES_PORT = 5432
POSTGRES_URI = postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}
```

### üîπ Start the Application

```sh
python3 run.py
```



## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment
This repo's version of grocerymate has been adapted to be deployed to AWS.
To this end, a GitHub action will containerize the code as defined by the [Dockerfile](./backend/Dockerfile).
The resulting image is stored in the GitHub container registry (ghcr.io).


### üìã Prerequisites
All necessary infrastructure is defined via [terraform](./terraform). 
Terraform is set up to use S3 as backend to store its state. Create the S3 bucket and [enter its name here](./terraform/providers.tf) under "backend".
Deploying the grocerymate webstore needs a manual bootstrapping process to populate the RDS.


### üîÑ‚òÅÔ∏è GitHub to AWS 
Deploying via GitHub actions needs read/write access to several AWS services, 
among which are S3, ECS, IAM, RDS, SSM (Parameter Store). 

#### OpenID Connect Setup
In order for GitHub (actions) to be allowed to interact with your AWS Account,
the recommended way is to configure an "OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP) inside an AWS account, 
[and] use IAM roles and short-term credentials, which removes the need for IAM user access keys" ([source: GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect))

Click this link and follow the instructions: [OpenID Connect: AWS-GitHub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/)

#### üßë‚Äçüîß GitHub Deployment Role Permissions
Assuming you have set up GitHub to request a short-lived access token directly from the cloud provider (see above)
you will have to assign permissions to your GitHub deployment role (Gdr). As already mentioned, several and widespread permissions have to be granted.
For the purpose of this documentation, it is assumed that your GitHub is the representation of yourself when deploying infrastructure to AWS.
Thus - even though it does not follow least-privilege - consider granting AdministratorAccess (*arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess*).


### üîπ Database Backend Setup
If you are deploying the app for the first time, you will not have a snapshot to restore the RDS databse from. 
In this case, use a temporary EC2 instance and seed the db as described.

#### **Step by step - RDS seeding**:
1. Boot up RDS with PostgreSQL version ~=15 on AWS‚Äîuse the configuration in [terraform](./terraform/rds.tf) without restoring from a snapshot.
2. Run an EC2 instance with the following user data (or install psql manually).
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum install -y postgresql15 git
  ```
3. Log into the instance and use the commands above to
   a) set up the db as you would locally, but specify the RDS as host.
   b) clone this repo into and prefill the db. 
  Example:
  ```bash
  psql -h webstore-pg.czckmkgc6alw.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE grocerymate_db;"
  ```
4. Save your credentials (+ port & db name) to GitHub vars.
5. Take an RDS snapshot.
6. Enter the snapshot name into [terraform](./terraform/rds.tf).
7. Tear down on AWS (e.g., EC2 & RDS).

#### RDS Configuration
Terraform configures RDS and its related resources with the following
* Private subnet deployment‚Äîno public access.
* Accessible only by your app's SecurityGroup.
* Single-Zone AZ deployment, due to recreation from snapshot.


### Deployment
Before running the [GitHub action - "AWS Deployment Workflow"](./.github/workflows/aws-deployment.yml):
Ensure that you have set all variables as GitHub variables / secrets and enabled the pipeline to access them.
Variables needed:
* POSTGRES_DB
* POSTGRES_PORT
* POSTGRES_USER
* POSTGRES_PWD

Also, make sure to replace the VPC & subnet ids as well as the aws-region with the appropriate ones from your AWS account.
In addition, uncomment the var.db_username and var.db_password variable usage in [the RDS definition](./terraform/rds.tf). 

Finally, you should be good to go! üöÄ
